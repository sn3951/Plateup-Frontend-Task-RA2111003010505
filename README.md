# PlateUp Frontend Task

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of an evaluation process to demonstrate skills in web development, particularly in React, CSS/SCSS, responsive design, and following specific design instructions.

## Task Overview

## Project Highlights

- **Responsive Design:** The project ensures a seamless experience across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, with adaptive layouts and components.
- **UI/UX Implementation:** The user interface was carefully crafted to align with the PlateUp brand and user experience guidelines, focusing on intuitive navigation and visually appealing elements.

## Development Guidelines

- **No CSS Libraries:** To fully assess UI building skills, no CSS libraries (Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material UI, etc.) were used. Styling was done entirely with vanilla CSS/SCSS.
